# Counter-Strike 2 Wallhack – X-Ray Vision That Turns You Into a One-Man Army 🧠🔫

Let’s be real — in CS2, **info is power**. The difference between winning a clutch and getting dunked on is often *knowing* where the enemy is. With a **CS2 Wallhack**, that’s exactly what you get: full, live, **through-the-wall player visuals** so you can pre-aim, rotate smart, and frag without guessing.

Whether you’re trying to hold site, lurk mid, or clear corners like a psychic, wallhacks give you that dirty but *deadly* unfair edge. 🔥

## 👀 What Is a Wallhack in CS2?

A **wallhack** lets you **see enemies through walls** by overlaying their positions on your screen. It’s usually done via:

* ✨ **Glow ESP**
* 🔲 **Box ESP**
* 🧍 **Skeletons or Bones**
* 📍 **Distance/Names/Weapons**

This cheat doesn’t affect gameplay directly like an aimbot — you still aim and shoot — but now you **know exactly where to look.**

Great for:

* Entry fraggers
* Lurkers
* Site anchors
* Eco gods
